# Circles

![showcase](https://github.com/patrik-u/circles/blob/main/showcase.jpg)

Circles is an open-source social media platform for change makers, for co-creators, for problem solvers, for people that want to make a real difference in the world. For people that care. For people that dream of a better world for everyone. Welcome!

We receive contributions from a number of different people and networks. We will never allow any form of funding that will influence the platform in any direction the community does not approve of. We will not mine or sell personal data and we will not host any ads. 

This is an early version of the platform, we have a lot of ideas about where we want to take this next. If youâ€™d like to join our team and volunteer network or contribute in any other way, please get in touch.
